# **Hello** ðŸ‘‹ 

## My name is Julia.

+ I don't have any hobbies and am currently pondering the reason for my existence. By that I mean, what makes me happy and what am I going to do with myself?
+ I don't believe there is any reason for anybody's existence or for anything at all. I would like to think of myself as stoic but really I'm just nihilistic

# *Thank you for coming to my ted talk* ðŸ˜˜
